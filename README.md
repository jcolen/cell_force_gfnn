# Green's function neural networks for adherent cell mechanics

This is one of three code repositories for the paper **Zyxin is all you need: machine learning adherent cell mechanics** (https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.00176). 
This code is used for generating the results in Figure 6, which presents a physics-agnostic model building pipeline combining GFNN and SINDy methods.

The other two repositories for this paper are:
- U-Net analysis: https://github.com/schmittms/cell_force_prediction
- Physical bottleneck analysis: https://github.com/schmittms/physical_bottleneck
